Amazon X-Ray feature implemented in Kindle Amazon to access the general reference information such as dictionary, encyclopedia and information about characters featured in stories without using internet. This feature was further upgraded in Amazon Prime Videos to display the IMDb profile of characters, and information about music and trivia of the video instantaneously while watching it without disturbing viewer’s experience. Our idea is to employ face recognition and display information about the character by clicking on the character’s face during video playback itself. We extend this to a further step by providing an advertising platform during the course of video itself, instead of having an intermission to advertise products. This is done by employing object detection algorithms on the video feed and providing an easy option to buy them online with the help of web scrapping and an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI).
